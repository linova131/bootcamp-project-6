# Project-6-Express-Node-Site

3 Changes Made to the CSS to Personalize

-The sidebar color has been changed to medium gray. Accordingly, I also adjusted the p text here to be a little darker for readibility.
-I added text shadows to the H1 and H5 elements.
-When hovering over the project images on the index page, the image will increase 105%.
